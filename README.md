# 😺 Kynix
A minimal Vite SPA starter with a router and page support, made by [katniny](https://github.com/katniny)!

> [!NOTE]
> Kynix does not support TypeScript.

## 🛠️ Get Started
1. Run `npm create kynix my-name`
    - Replace `my-name` with a project name, or use . to use current directory. Leaving this empty will use `kynix-app` by default
2. After the app is created, run `cd my-name`
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Run the app with `npm run dev`
5. Enjoy!

## 📖 How to Use
Kynix is easy-to-learn by design, but we have some documentation [here](https://github.com/katniny/kynix/tree/main/documentation).

## ❓ FAQ
1. Does Kynix support TypeScript?
    - No, I do not use TypeScript and it is not supported by Kynix. If you want to open a PR adding support for TypeScript, I am not against this, however I will do not do this myself.
2. Is Kynix a framework?
    - No.
3. Does Kynix use NPM dependencies?
    - Only Vite!
4. Does Kynix use HTML?
    - Yes! This is how we make pages/components, but don't make multiple .html files for pages. See our [documentation](https://github.com/katniny/kynix/tree/main/documentation/NewPage.md).
